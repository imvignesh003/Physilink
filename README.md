# PhysiLink

## Abstract:
In the hectic life of 21th century, taking complete care of people with disabilities and elderly ones have become a tedious task to young generation. In order to simplify this hurdle, we have come up with our PhysiLink. The physilink comes up with inbuilt customized dashboards for Differently-abled one, the caretakers and the clinical assistants as well. The primary motive of the Differently-abled people’s dashboard is to provide the cognitive assistance to them such as remainders (Medication intake, Appointments, food), timers, etc. It also has the role of indicating the real time location to the caretakes dashboard and an emergency assistance to immediately aid help from caretakers. It could contain all the featural options to satisfy all the needs of the Differently-abled ones. On the other hand, the caretaker dashboard displays all the activities of differently-abled ones, also the completion of remainders and tasks at specified time. The app can be integrated with home automation sensor systems to ease the workflow or lifecycle of respected ones like integration with home appliances, security systems. It can also be integrated with medicine dispensers to feed the prescription to the medicine dispenser and dispense the pills.
